#  Robo Dog Leg Movement (Arduino + Servo Motors)

This Arduino project controls the movement of a robotic dog's legs using four servo motors. Each leg is assigned to a separate servo, and the program moves them in a coordinated sequence to simulate walking motion.

## 📝 Requirements
- Arduino board
- 4x Servo Motors
- Jumper wires
- External power supply
