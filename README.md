#  Robo Dog Leg Movement (Arduino + Servo Motors)

This Arduino project controls the movement of a robotic dog's legs using four servo motors. Each leg is assigned to a separate servo, and the program moves them in a coordinated sequence to simulate walking motion.

## 📝 Requirements
- Arduino board (Uno, Mega, etc.)
- 4x Servo Motors
- Jumper wires
- External power supply

## 🏗 Wiring
